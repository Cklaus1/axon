# Session Status — ASI Build Loop

**Branch:** `governance-audit-2026-07-18` (not main; not yet pushed to origin)

## Landed this iteration (commit `216fc6a`)

- Re-verified R32/R33/R34 acceptance gates (all pass; R32 has 2 honest SKIPs — TLC/coqc not
  installed on this host) and corrected `ROADMAP.md` §10.6 + `governance/REQUIREMENTS.md`, which
  both still claimed "zero proof code" / "no implementation" / "not started" for work that was
  already real and gate-green in the tree.
- Added §13 Dependency DAG + §14 Evidence ledger to R32/R33 (R34 already had them).
- Fixed two `scripts/verify_all_specs.sh` findings: emoji-strip regex missing 🚧/🔧 (false-positive
  status mismatch), R34's dangling `related: R28-audit-ledger-writer` → corrected to the real
  `R28-capability-audit-ledger`. Verifier now reports CLEAN (53 pre-convention specs remain, by
  design — backfilled only on next edit, not mass-mechanically).

## Known gate flakiness (corrected this iteration — was mischaracterized as a stable pre-existing gap)

- `scripts/gate.sh`'s full-suite `cargo test` occasionally fails one `wasm_browser_*` test (seen as
  `wasm_browser_println_matches_interp_via_js_host` in one run, `wasm_browser_examples_run_identically_via_js_host`
  in another/`R34`'s evidence ledger). **This is a flake under full-workspace parallel contention,
  not a stable known gap**: `bash scripts/wasm_browser_io_parity.sh` run directly passes 6/6;
  `cargo test --exact` on the single failing test passes in <1s; an immediate full-suite rerun
  passes 419/419. Corrected `governance/specs/R34-incremental-attestation.md` §14 to match (it
  previously asserted "KNOWN GAP (pre-existing)", which overclaimed a stable, characterized bug).
  **Going forward: never dismiss a red `wasm_browser_*` test without an isolated rerun first** —
  if the isolated rerun ALSO fails, that's a real regression, not this flake.
- Separately found and fixed a REAL, reproducible, deterministic gate blocker: a clippy violation
  in `crates/axon-core/src/main.rs:846` (`format!("{}…", &name.chars()...)` — redundant `&`),
  pre-existing on this branch, unrelated to anything else this session touched. Confirmed via
  `cargo clippy -p axon-core --bin axon --no-default-features -- -D warnings` before and after the
  one-line fix. This is why the first two gate reruns this session failed at different steps
  (tests, then clippy) — they were two independent, unrelated problems, not the same one recurring.

## Not yet decided (owed to the user, not a loop default)

- Whether to push `governance-audit-2026-07-18` to origin.
- The `KNOWN_DUAL` allowlist in `verify_all_specs.sh` (R18/R21-R25 dual-numbering) — flagged for
  human sanity-check, not yet reconciled or confirmed as intentionally-legacy.

## Next candidate slice

- Fix the wasm-browser example-link gap (`wasm_browser_println_matches_interp_via_js_host`) if a
  future iteration has bandwidth — it's the one thing keeping `gate.sh` from being fully green.
- Or: continue the outer-loop sweep into the 53 pre-convention specs (add spec-meta on next real
  edit per `EXECUTION_MODEL.md` §3 backfill policy — not a mass mechanical pass).
