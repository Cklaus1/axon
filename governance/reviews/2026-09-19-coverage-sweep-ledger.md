# Coverage sweep ledger — pinned baseline fccc4bc

Surfaces with NO test / example / harness that executes them (15, measured
against `BUILTINS` in `crates/axon-core/src/builtins.rs`, excluding mentions
in `builtins.rs` itself and in generated `AXON_REFERENCE.md`).

One domain per worktree. No two agents share a checkout.

| Agent | Branch | Assigned surfaces |
|---|---|---|
| numeric | `sweep/numeric` | `volatile_load_u16`, `volatile_load_u32`, `volatile_load_u64`, `bpf_get_smp_processor_id`, `bpf_ktime_get_ns` |
| kernel | `sweep/kernel` | `principal_spend`, `scheduler_done_count`, `supervisor_restarts` |
| json | `sweep/json` | `json_arr_f64`, `json_arr_from_f64`, `json_get_i64`, `json_path_json` |
| uncertain | `sweep/uncertain` | `uncertain_confidence`, `uncertain_deterministic`, `uncertain_dyn_f64` |
| audit | `sweep/audit` | none — audits the COVERAGE METRIC itself (see below) |

The audit agent exists because "named in a test file" is not "executed by a
test". The 15 above are the surfaces named NOWHERE executable; a builtin
named in a comment, a doc string, or a `BUILTINS`-adjacent table reads as
covered under the same query and may be exercised by nothing. That gap is
the same absent-vs-passed collapse this sweep is looking for, one level up.

## Outcome (filled in by the orchestrator)

Two honest verdicts per surface, not one:
- **verified-sound** — probed, behaviour correct, minimum semantic coverage added
- **defect** — reproduced minimally, mechanism identified, regression test
  mutation-verified, fix committed

Lacking coverage is not itself a defect and must not be reported as one.
