# v0.22 PSV protocol — authority contract and frozen schemas (step 0)

Status: **DRAFT, frozen before implementation** (operator direction, 2026-09-28). This fixes, before
any M1 code:
- which trust domain produces every load-bearing protected field;
- the O1 authority contract;
- the formats M1–M4 exchange.

Companion to:
- `v022-protected-suite-verdict.md`, the acceptance surface;
- `v022-psv-gap-map.md`, the gaps and the adversarial matrix A1–A19.

It certifies nothing, and it moves no readiness component.

## Build order

```
0. freeze these schemas + the O1 contract            (this document)
1. O1  operator-pinned launcher, profile, suite registry, signing key
2. M1  guest verdict runner + sealed input transport
3. M2  protected verdict + Fabric dispatch/attestation   ─┐ M3 may proceed in parallel
4. M3  observer / preflight join                          ─┘ once §3 is frozen
5. O2  loop verifier/observer keys from the operator root  (parallel with M1/M2)
6. M4  intake / EVL protected joins                        (O2 is a HARD prerequisite)
7. A1–A21 negative matrix complete  →  PSV_PROTOCOL_PROVEN
```

Throughout:

```
PSV_PROTOCOL_PROVEN        eventually PASS (dev host; no readiness credit)
protected_backend          NOT_RUN
g01_on_protected_backend   NOT_RUN
pci_on_protected_backend   NOT_RUN
PROTECTED_VERIFIER_READY   NOT_READY
```

## 1. Trusted producer of every protected field

No load-bearing protected field may originate from MiCode, the candidate, the repository, or a
caller-supplied path.

| Field | Produced by | Enforced by |
|---|---|---|
| candidate tree digest | Fabric, over its workspace store | M1 (guest re-digest), M4 (join) |
| suite id / version / entry / tree digest | the operator suite registry (O1) | M1, M4 |
| test id | the experiment's `task_acceptance`; the request NAMES it | M1 (runs only it), M4 |
| per-attempt completion secret | Fabric's CSPRNG, per attempt | §4 |
| completion proof | the trusted guest runner | M2 (host recomputation) |
| guest kernel / rootfs / runtime / init digests | the operator profile manifest (O1), pinned by the B263 qualification | M2, M3, M4 |
| launcher digest | the operator host config (O1) | M3 (observed), M4 |
| launch manifest | Fabric | M3 (observed), M4 |
| preflight observation | the observer (`/etc/axon/trust/observer/`) | M3, M4 |
| B263 qualification | `/etc/axon/trust/qualification/` | Fabric (exists), M4 |
| attestation signing key | the operator host config (O1); readable ONLY by the Fabric service UID | O1, preflight |
| verifier / observer public keys, for the loop | `/etc/axon/trust/{verifier,observer}/` | O2 |
| trial / attempt / operation | the experiment, bound by Fabric | exists |

A thirteenth origin, found while writing this: Fabric's attestation signing key is named INSIDE the
caller-supplied check registry (`signer.key_path`, resolved relative to it,
`bin/axon-fabric.rs:151-181`). O1 removes it with the registry.

## 2. O1 — the authority contract

**Protected mode takes no configuration from the caller.** A request with
`hardware_isolation=true, os=linux` resolves EVERYTHING that defines the protected run from one
operator-owned file:

```
/etc/axon/protected-host.json            root-owned walk from /, no g/o write, no symlink
{
  "schema": "axon-protected-host/1",
  "launcher":       {"path": "/usr/local/libexec/axon/fc_linux_profile.sh", "sha256": "…"},
  "profile_manifest": {"path": "/usr/local/share/axon/linux-microvm/manifest.json", "sha256": "…"},
  "artifacts_dir":  "/usr/local/share/axon/linux-microvm/dist",
  "qualification":  {"record": "/var/lib/axon/b263/record.json", "signature": "….sig", "waivers": null},
  "suite_registry": {"path": "/usr/local/share/axon/suites/registry.json", "sha256": "…"},
  "suite_store":    "/var/lib/axon/suites",
  "signer":         {"issuer_ref": "…", "public_key": "…", "key_path": "/var/lib/axon/fabric/attest.pk8"},
  "out_root":       "/var/lib/axon/fabric/runs",
  "observer":       {"nonce_store": "/var/lib/axon/custodian/nonces", "max_age_s": 300}
}
```

Rules:
1. **Every path is absolute and operator-owned.** `check_operator_owned` applies to:
   - the host config;
   - the launcher;
   - the profile manifest;
   - the artifacts;
   - the suite registry.

   Each file's sha256 must equal its pin. The signing key is owned by the Fabric service UID, mode
   0400, and every ancestor is operator-owned.
2. **No caller override.** In protected mode, `submit` REFUSES:
   - `--linux-launcher`, `--linux-manifest`, `--linux-artifacts`;
   - `--linux-evidence*`, `--linux-waivers`, `--linux-out-root`;
   - a `--check-registry` whose suite would be used.

   It refuses rather than ignores, as it already does for `--linux-trusted-issuers`. A missing or
   non-conforming host config makes the profile INELIGIBLE, with no fallback.
3. **The caller names, never points.**
   - The request names a registered suite by id (`check:<id>`) and the test by name.
   - Version, entry and tree come from the operator registry; the candidate tree comes from
     Fabric's store.
4. **One source per thing.** The attestation signer comes from the host config, never from a
   registry file. The development-class `--check-registry` path keeps its own signer for local
   runs, which can never produce protected evidence (§6).
5. **Test roots only behind `test-trust-root`.** `ProtectedHostConfig::for_test(root)` has no
   production constructor, and a test-trust build reports `build: "test-trust"`.
6. **The trust preflight grows** (`scripts/trust_root_preflight.sh`):
   - agent UIDs can neither READ the signing key nor write any O1 path;
   - the Fabric UID can read the key but cannot write it.

Negative cases O1 must discriminate (added to the matrix):

| # | Case | Refused by |
|---|---|---|
| A16 | a replaced launcher reporting chosen digests or exit | launcher sha256 ≠ host-config pin, so ineligible |
| A17 | a caller-supplied suite registry | protected mode reads only the host config's registry |
| A20 | Fabric signing key readable by an agent UID | trust preflight (real read attempt) |
| A21 | any caller `--linux-*` / registry flag in protected mode | `submit` refuses, naming the flag |

## 3. Launch manifest — `axon-launch-manifest/1`

Built by Fabric per attempt, before the observation is requested. Its digest is
`sha256(canonical JSON)`, using the `axon_loop_contracts` canonical form: sorted keys, no
whitespace.

```json
{
  "schema": "axon-launch-manifest/1",
  "operation_id": "…", "task_id": "…", "trial_id": "…", "attempt_id": "…",
  "backend_profile": "linux-microvm-protected",
  "fabric_revision": "<40 hex>",
  "qualification_sha256": "<B263 record>",
  "host_config_sha256": "<axon-protected-host/1 file>",
  "launcher_sha256": "…", "firecracker_sha256": "…",
  "profile_manifest_sha256": "…",
  "guest": {"kernel_sha256": "…", "rootfs_sha256": "…", "axon_sha256": "…", "init_sha256": "…"},
  "policy_sha256": "<guest policy bytes>",
  "suite": {"id": "…", "version": "<WorkspaceVersion>", "entry": "…", "test": "…",
            "tree_digest": "acf1:…", "registry_sha256": "…"},
  "candidate": {"workspace_version": "acf1:…", "tree_digest": "acf1:…"},
  "completion": {"scheme": "axon-guest-completion/1"},
  "observation_nonce": "<custodian nonce, hex>",
  "limits": {"wall_time_ms": 0, "output_bytes": 0}
}
```

It carries NO secret. The completion secret travels separately (§4).

## 4. Input transport and the completion proof (M1)

**Structurally distinct, read-only inputs.** Each is a separate virtio block device, attached
read-only by the launcher. The guest mounts it `ro,nodev,nosuid,noexec`.

| Device | Content | Mounted at |
|---|---|---|
| `input-0` | candidate tree (the exact WorkspaceVersion from Fabric's store) | `/in/candidate` |
| `input-1` | operator suite tree (from the registry) | `/in/suite` |
| `job` | `launch-manifest.json`, `completion-secret` (mode 0400, root), guest policy | `/in/job` (read-only) |
| `out` | the verdict and the run's output | `/out` (the only writable device) |

**Before executing anything**, the guest runner:
1. re-computes the acf1 tree digest of `/in/candidate` and `/in/suite`, using the same algorithm
   as Fabric's store (shared code, not a re-implementation);
2. compares each digest with the launch manifest, and the manifest with the digest Fabric named on
   the kernel command line;
3. on any mismatch, writes `status: refused`, and executes nothing.

**Completion proof.** Per attempt, Fabric generates a 32-byte secret `S` from its CSPRNG. `S` is
written only to the job device and kept in Fabric's memory; it never appears in the manifest, a
receipt, a log or the journal.

```
B = canonical JSON {
      scheme: "axon-guest-completion/1",
      operation_id, trial_id, attempt_id,
      suite_id, suite_version, entry, test,
      candidate_tree_digest, suite_tree_digest,
      launch_manifest_digest }
K = HMAC-SHA256(S, "axon-guest-completion/1\n" || sha256(B))
token(test) = completion_token(K, test)    -- the existing PCI interpreter derivation
```

- The runner derives `K` from the manifest it VERIFIED. It hands `K` to
  `axon test --completion-key-stdin --seal /in/candidate` over stdin, and never exposes `S` or `K`
  to candidate code.
- Candidate code runs unprivileged in the guest (`AXON_PATH` = `/in/candidate`, exclusive). The
  secret file is readable only by root.
- The host recomputes `K` from `S` and its OWN `B`, never from anything the guest reports.

A proof from another attempt, candidate, suite, test or manifest therefore does not verify (A11).

## 5. Guest verdict — `axon-guest-verdict/1`

Written by the runner to `/out/verdict.json`. Its sha256 is also emitted on the serial console
(`PSV-VERDICT sha256=<hex>`) and cross-checked by the launcher, as `B263-OUT` is today.

```json
{
  "schema": "axon-guest-verdict/1",
  "launch_manifest_sha256": "…",
  "inputs": {"candidate_tree_digest": "acf1:…", "suite_tree_digest": "acf1:…", "match": true},
  "test": "…",
  "status": "passed | failed | unknown | refused",
  "refusal": null,
  "exit_code": 0,
  "report": {"passed": ["…"], "failed": [], "completion": [["…", "<token>"]]},
  "runner": {"init_sha256": "…", "axon_sha256": "…"},
  "stdout_sha256": "…"
}
```

The guest's `status` is a CLAIM. Fabric derives the verdict:
- `passed` only if the test named in the manifest is in `report.passed`, the completion token
  verifies under the host-derived `K`, the exit code is 0, `inputs.match` holds, and the digests
  equal the manifest's;
- otherwise `failed` (a named failure with a clean run) or `unknown`.

## 6. Protected attestation rule (M2)

The current rule, "protected backend OR empty effect ceiling → may sign"
(`signing.rs:47`), is replaced by two separate evidence classes:

```
PROTECTED evidence  ⇐  profile linux-microvm-protected
                     AND B263 qualification valid at dispatch
                     AND host config (O1) conforming, launcher and manifest at their pins
                     AND launch manifest built by THIS Fabric for THIS attempt
                     AND observation verified (§7): observer domain, nonce unused, fresh, joins
                     AND guest verdict cross-checked (drive = serial digest)
                     AND inputs.match, digests = manifest
                     AND completion verified under the host-derived K
                     AND the attestation signer is the host config's

DEVELOPMENT evidence ⇐ an effect-free local check (today's rule). Never protected.
```

The class is carried INSIDE what is signed. The receipt's `evidence_refs` gain these entries,
covered by the receipt digest the attestation binds:
- `evidence-class:protected` or `evidence-class:development`;
- `launch-manifest-sha256:`;
- `preflight-observation-sha256:`;
- `guest-verdict-sha256:`;
- `guest-kernel-sha256:`, `guest-rootfs-sha256:`, `guest-axon-sha256:`;
- `suite:<id>@<version>#<entry>/<test>`;
- `qualification-sha256:`.

`acf-receipt-attestation/2` stays; MiCode's check of it is unchanged. M2 must first confirm that
the attestation binding covers the receipt digest, including `evidence_refs`. If it does not, the
schema moves to `/3` and MiCode moves with it.

## 7. Preflight observation — `axon-preflight-observation/1` (M3)

Per ADR-002, extended with the O1 digests:

```json
{
  "schema": "axon-preflight-observation/1",
  "observer_key_id": "ed25519:…",
  "nonce": "<custodian-issued, hex>", "epoch": 0, "observed_at": "…Z",
  "host_profile": "linux-microvm-protected",
  "fabric_revision": "…", "firecracker_sha256": "…",
  "launcher_sha256": "…", "host_config_sha256": "…",
  "guest": {"kernel_sha256": "…", "rootfs_sha256": "…", "axon_sha256": "…", "init_sha256": "…"},
  "verifier_sha256": "<installed axon-fabric>", "suite_registry_sha256": "…",
  "policy_sha256": "…",
  "intended_launch_manifest_sha256": "…"
}
```

- It is signed with an OBSERVER-domain `axon-evidence-signature/2`, under
  `/etc/axon/trust/observer/`.
- The custodian issues the nonce, and it is consumed once: a second use is refused (A15). The
  observation is refused when older than `max_age_s` or from another epoch (A8).
- The sequence is custodian nonce, then the manifest (which contains the nonce), then the
  observation of the manifest digest, then the launch. It is not circular: the manifest names the
  nonce, and the observation names the manifest.
- Fabric verifies and consumes an observation. It holds no observer key and cannot mint one.

## 8. O2 — loop key authority

- In the PROTECTED class, intake, EVL and admission resolve a claimed verifier key ONLY from
  `/etc/axon/trust/verifier/*.pub`, and observer keys only from `/etc/axon/trust/observer/*.pub`.
  Both use the operator-owned walk, the same code as Fabric's `TrustAuthority`.
- The store's `verifier_keys` may NARROW (list a subset); it never adds (A18).
- The development class keeps store keys.
- Test roots exist only behind a test-only feature.
- O2 lands before M4. Otherwise M4's joins would verify against keys an agent can plant.

## 9. M4 — loop-side joins (protected class)

A result counts as protected only if all of these hold:
- the attestation verifies under an O2 key;
- the receipt names `evidence-class:protected`;
- the launch-manifest digest equals the observation's `intended_launch_manifest_sha256`;
- the observation verifies under an O2 observer key, fresh and in epoch;
- the guest digests equal the qualification's;
- suite, test, candidate, trial, attempt and operation all equal the experiment's.

Anything less is Unverifiable in the protected class (PSV-7). It is never silently development.

## 10. Adversarial matrix

These cases are written before the mechanisms. The gap map holds A1–A19; §2 adds A20 and A21. Each
mechanism's slice names the rows it must turn from "missing" to "refused for the stated reason",
and its tests assert the reason.

## Amendments made during implementation

These are recorded here rather than edited into the frozen text above.

1. **A third evidence class, `guest-unobserved` (M2).** §6 names two classes. The implementation
   has a third: a verdict produced on the guest path and fully checked by Fabric (§5), but without a
   verified preflight observation. It is signed as `guest-unobserved`, and is never protected; only
   M3's verified observation makes a verdict `protected`. The class is inside the signed receipt
   (`evidence-class:` ref), and the attestation rule signs each class only where its backend derives
   it (`signing::WRONG_CLASS`).
2. **The child's output is `/out/test-stdout` and `/out/test-stderr` (M1).** §5 said `stdout`.
   The first real boot showed that `/init` already redirects the runner's own stdout to
   `/out/stdout`, and sharing it corrupted the child's output.
3. **Launcher exit 27, `verdict-unbound` (M1).** It was not in §4. It means the verdict on the
   returned drive is not the one `/init` hashed on the serial console, or the guest named another
   launch manifest. It is not admissible.
